# 💀📈 UNDERLINERY — OFFICIAL RULEBOOK v1.0

*Minimal rules. Maximum mind games. No excuses.*

---

## 1️⃣ GAME OVERVIEW

🧠 **Underlinery** is a turn‑based, hidden‑information strategy game for two players.

No movement. No reflexes. Just foresight, prediction, and psychological warfare.

🎯 **Win Condition:** complete **11 lines** (called *ticks*) before your opponent.

---

## 2️⃣ COMPONENTS

🧱 Two private **11×11 grids** (one per player)

🔢 Numbers **1–121**

🤖 **System / AI Referee**

* Handles toss
* Validates actions
* Tracks ticks

🚫 Players can **never** see the opponent’s grid.

---

## 3️⃣ SETUP — PLACEMENT PHASE

📦 Each player receives an empty **11×11 grid**.

📐 Players independently place numbers **1–121**, one per cell.

Rules:

* Any number → any cell
* Every number used **exactly once**
* Placement is **single‑click per cell**

🔒 When all **121 cells** are filled, grids are **locked**.

⚠️ **No changes after lock.** Poor planning = skill issue.

---

## 4️⃣ TOSS RULE — 🛑 ANTI‑RNG POLICY

🎲 The system performs **one** toss.

🏆 The toss winner chooses **ONE** advantage:

* **Option A:** First placement (placement phase)
* **Option B:** First move (match phase)

🚫 You cannot have both.

💡 *Skill > luck. Always.*

---

## 5️⃣ MATCH PHASE — CORE LOOP

🔁 Players alternate turns.

On your turn:

1. Select **ONE number** (1–121)
2. That number is crossed out on **BOTH grids** automatically
3. The system checks for completed lines

⛔ No confirmations. No takebacks.

🧱 One action. Final.

---

## 6️⃣ TICKS — SCORING

✅ A *tick* is earned when a player completes:

* A full **row**
* A full **column**
* A full **diagonal**

Rules:

* 🟢 Each completed line = **1 tick**
* 🔥 Multiple lines in one move = **multiple ticks**
* 🤖 Ticks are tracked automatically

---

## 7️⃣ WIN CONDITION

🏁 The first player to reach **11 ticks** wins immediately.

❓ Why 11?

Because **UNDERLINERY has 11 letters**.

📈 *Brand > convenience. Deal with it.*

---

## 8️⃣ INFORMATION RULES

🚫 You **cannot** see the opponent’s grid.

👀 You **can** see:

* Numbers already called
* Your own completed ticks
* Opponent’s **tick count** (not layout)

🧠 This is a mind game — not *Battleship with training wheels*.

---

## 9️⃣ INTERFACE RULES — IMPORTANT

🖱️ Placement:

* Click cell → assign number → done

🧮 Turns:

* Click number → system resolves

🚫 No dragging
🚫 No manual scoring
🚫 No UI clutter

🏢 Single input. System resolution.
*Enterprise‑grade UX.*

---

## 🔟 CONDUCT & EDGE CASES

🔌 Disconnect = **forfeit** (unless system reconnects you)

🛑 Illegal moves are blocked automatically

⏱️ Stalling is not allowed; turn timers may apply

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ MODES — FUTURE‑PROOFING

🚧 *Not in v1.0, but supported by design:*

* 🎮 Casual Mode (5 or 7 ticks)
* 🏆 Ranked Classic (11 ticks)
* ⚡ Abilities / power calls (limited, optional)
* 👁️ Spectator mode (no grid visibility)

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ DESIGN PHILOSOPHY — NON‑NEGOTIABLE

* ⚔️ Strategy over speed
* 🧩 Planning over reaction
* 🧠 Psychology over RNG
* 🧼 Clean rules over gimmicks

💬 *This game rewards thinking ahead, not button mashing.*
