A turn-based, hidden-information strategy game.  
No movement. No reflexes. Just foresight. 🧠

**Underlinery is Battleship for people who hate luck.**

---

## 🎯 Core Idea
Two players place numbers **1–121** on private **11×11 grids**.  
Players take turns calling numbers.  
Completed lines score **ticks**.  
**First to 11 ticks wins.**

📘 Full rules: **[Official Rulebook v1.0](./rulebook.md)**

## 🧠 Why It Exists
**Underlinery** rewards planning, prediction, and psychology over speed.

This game is built around **thinking ahead**, not reacting fast.  
Every move leaks information. Every call is a mind game.

Inspired by classic **systems-first** games — where rules are strict, outcomes are fair, and skill compounds.

Not a reflex test.  
Not RNG soup.  
Not casual bait.

## 🚧 Status
- ✅ **Ruleset v1.0 complete** (locked & implementation-authoritative)
- 🧪 **Web MVP in development**
- 🧍 **Solo dev / early-stage**

## ⚙️ Tech (Planned)
- 🌐 Web: **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**
- 🧩 No framework lock-in (by design)
- 🧠 System-resolved logic (no manual scoring, no disputes)

---

## 🧱 Design Philosophy
- Strategy over speed  
- Planning over reaction  
- Psychology over RNG  
- Clean rules over gimmicks  

If the system can resolve it, the player shouldn’t have to.
